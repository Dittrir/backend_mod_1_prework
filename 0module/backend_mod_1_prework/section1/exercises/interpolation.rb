# Example: Write code that uses the variables below to form a string that reads
# "The Chudley Cannons are Ron's favorite Quidditch team":
name = "Ron"
team = "Chudley Cannons"

p "The #{team} are #{name}'s favorite Quidditch team"

# Write code that uses the variables below to form a string that reads
# "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
speedy = "quick red fox"
slow_poke = "lazy brown dog"

p "The #{speedy} jumped over the #{slow_poke}"

# Write code that uses the variables below to form a string that reads
# "In a predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!":
slow_poke = "tortoise"
speedy = "hare"

p "In a predictable result, the #{slow_poke} beat the #{speedy}!"


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, name/content/data type of your choice. Think carefully about what you name the variables. Remember, the goal is to be concise but descriptive (it's a hard balance!) Then, log out ONE sentence that incorporates all THREE variables.
not_so_strong_but_smart = "David"
not_so_smart_but_strong = "Goliath"
type_of_battle = "single combat"

p "In the biblical book of Samual, the Philistine giant #{not_so_smart_but_strong} was defeated in #{type_of_battle} by the young #{not_so_strong_but_smart}."
